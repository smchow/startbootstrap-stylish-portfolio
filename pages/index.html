        <p class="lead">
            The Bengali Kids of Princeton Area (BKPA) is a volunteer-run organization for kids between the ages of 5 and 17. Our programs
            are generated by and focused on kids.
            <br>
            <br> As American Bengali Kids, we engage in lifelong pursuit of learning, give back to our local and global communities,
            and learn about our Bengali heritage while continuing the legacy of our rich culture. Our goals are to learn
            about our rich Bengali Heritage and Culture in a FUN way and become generous, thoughtful global citizens.
            <br>
            <br> Did you know that the US Government considers the Bengali language to be a critical language for the future
            of our country? Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world. For this reason and more, the US State
            Department believes in establishing relationships with the Bengali language and people for future development
            and prosperity. We hope our organization can help bridge the gap between American and Bengali cultures. The Bengali
            Kids of Princeton Area (BKPA) members have distinct cultural identities as American Bengalis. In this rapidly
            globalizing world, we believe it is important to forge connections across cultures and countries. BKPAâ€™s focus
            is to build these bridges in all parts of life, starting with the paths available from the popularity of our
            language. Through events, trips, and other programs we share Bengali culture with our local communities and maintain
            relationships with our friends abroad.
            <br>
            <br> We hold Bengali Heritage Class every Saturday, where members learn about Bengali heritage, culture, and language
            throughout the year. The Bengali Heritage Class recently developed a four-level curriculum for those who wish
            to learn how to speak, write, and read the Bengali language. BKPA has finalized this curriculum by publishing
            four workbooks in the Learn Bangla Now! series, one for each level of the curriculum, respectively. Bengali Heritage
            Class teaches us teamwork, leadership skills, public speaking, professionalism, and promotes hard work, honesty,
            discipline, fairness, and respect. Our teachers also help us to prepare for college, hold resume workshops, teach
            writing skills, and find opportunities for community work and summer internships. BKPA gives its members the
            opportunity to have a never-ending learning experience. Come join our Bengali Heritage Class and find out how
            much FUN it is!
            <br>
            <br> In addition to learning about language, culture, and heritage, our members and students also meet to discuss
            charitable goals, future events, and more. These ideas coalesce at quarterly meetings of students and staff at
            which we plan and review programs.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Four Pillars</h2>
        <p class="lead"> Kids are the base, foundation, and strength of this organization. BKPA was founded almost fifteen years ago by a
            small group of Bengali kids and has grown steadily ever since. Our organization focuses on four pillars of instruction:
            Educational, Cultural, Literary and Charitable.
