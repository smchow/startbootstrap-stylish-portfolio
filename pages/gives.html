        <p class="lead">
            <br> BKPA Gives is the charitable branch of BKPA. It grew out of discussions among students and teachers at our weekly
            language and heritage classes. In these classes we learn about communities around the globe where Bengali is
            spoken, and students raised the idea of assisting those in need in these communities to their mentors and teachers.
            Events such as free performances in assisted living facilities and other venues, fundraising walks, and more
            operate in the USA. Our program “International Technology for Self Sufficiency” currently operates in India and
            Bangladesh, and “International Technology for Career Education” will be operational in a location to be announced
            soon, bringing computers to a school for adult career education.
            <br>
            <br> We also fund a growing number of scholarships in India through Poets Foundation, and donate clothes and shoes
            to kids and adults in need. If you would like to be involved in our technology and clothing drives, please contact
            <a href="bkpa@bkpa.org">bkpa@bkpa.org</a>.
            <br>
            <br> On BKPA member summer volunteer trips to orphanages in Kolkata, we met young adults who were too old to receive
            aid from area orphanages but still struggling to make a living on their own. Some of these individuals have disabilities
            that make it difficult for them to travel to daily jobs. So, the BKPA Gives International Technology for Self
            Sufficiency and International Technology for Career Education programs were born. We provide individuals in need
            with the materials and funds needed to use technology to broaden their education and create modern careers. These
            tools can also help connect recipients with both their local and global communities. Initial and annual check-ins
            both online and in person offer continued community and support between BKPA members and BKPA Gives program recipients.
            Since 2014 we have brought computers to seven people who can then support themselves and their families. On the
            local level, we perform in assisted living facilities, providing free entertainment and food to residents, and
            open all of our annual cultural event to the public so that they may learn with us about our culture, language,
            and heritage. Our language classes are open to all free of charge as well. Teachers and mentors volunteer their
            time, the only fee being to cover printing costs of the language textbook and workbook that we produce. We hope
            that this openness encourages dialogue between people from different cultures.
            <br>
            <br> An outline of what we do in each BKPA Gives program is below. We encourage members to take initiative and coordinate
            with individuals they meet in their travels and daily life to design programs. All programs are brainstormed
            by the kids of BKPA, with guidance, oversight, and operational support from our adult members, teachers, and
            families. All members participate in our charitable events and other programs as volunteers. We believe part
            of our duty as global citizens is to give back to our communities and assist those in difficult circumstances.
